# what I was trying to do

This week I had tried three different new things: KoBoToolbox forms, coding in R, and an introduction to SQL. I successfully completed the KoBoToolbox and the basic stats in R portions, however I was only able to get about halfway through the Databases part.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

Data collection and manipulation is a very important part of archaeology, and so it ties nicely into my field of study.

## what I did

+ created my first KoBoToolbox form
	+ I created a new form and modified it to be more accessible for accepting various forms of data by adding several "other" options when faced with fields where you must choose a certain option. 
+ coded in R for the first time
	+ R is an interesting language and I was able to use it to try and find associations between data, along with visually represent it using various types of graphs. I did this for external data sets, along with the data for the Graveyard Project.
+ began the introduction to SQL
	+ I was able to complete the first basic excercises in the introduction to SQL portion, however I was not able to import the graveyard project database due to an error I have not seen before. Due to a lack of time, I decided to skip the second half of this section.

## challenges 

The main challenge I had during this week was not being able to import the Graveyard Project database into the Jupyter notebook. I feel that since I have used SQL in the past, it isn't as bad that I was forced to skip this section, but I still did not have the chance to experiment with the data in this way.

## thoughts on where to go next

Databases are used everywhere in one form or another, and can be found in every workplace, so this is far from the last time I will be using them. The next place for me to go from here would be to take what I've learned and use possibly use it on other data.
